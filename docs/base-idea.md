# AutoSyndicate™ — Executable Loans and Intelligent Capital Allocation

## CONTEXT

You are designing a **prototype** for the **LMA EDGE Hackathon**, organised by the Loan Market Association (LMA), the authoritative body representing loan markets across **Europe, the Middle East, and Africa**.

The judges are experienced professionals from banking, private credit, legal, risk, operations, and market infrastructure. They are evaluating submissions based on **commercial viability, scalability, efficiency gains, transparency, and real-world impact** and they are non-technicals.

The project must demonstrate how technology can meaningfully improve **how loans are originated, documented, allocated, traded, monitored, and reported** in institutional loan markets.

The solution must reflect how **institutional loan markets actually operate** across EMEA today, while clearly demonstrating how technology can:

- Turn loan agreements into structured, operational assets
- Reduce friction in capital allocation and syndication
- Increase transparency throughout the loan lifecycle
- Ensure ongoing compliance and performance visibility
- Embed sustainability considerations directly into lending decisions

The judges are not looking for consumer lending platforms or speculative finance.
They are evaluating **practical infrastructure ideas** that could realistically be adopted by banks, funds, agents, and market participants.

## CORE CONCEPT

AutoSyndicate™ treats each loan as a **living financial instrument** rather than a static legal document.

From the moment a loan is proposed, it is expressed as:

- A structured set of economic terms
- A collection of executable obligations
- A transparent allocation of risk and capital
- A continuously monitored relationship between borrower and lenders

Capital is not manually “placed” into loans.
Instead, it is **allocated by design**, based on clearly defined preferences and constraints, and remains actively governed throughout the loan’s life.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Institutional loan markets today face persistent challenges:

- Loans exist primarily as long-form legal documents rather than structured data
- Capital allocation and syndication rely heavily on manual processes and relationships
- Limited transparency into how and why capital is allocated to specific loans
- Fragmented monitoring of covenants, obligations, and performance
- Inconsistent ESG data capture and reporting across loans
- High operational cost and risk in secondary loan trading

These issues reduce efficiency, increase risk, and limit scalability across global loan markets.

## HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS (END-TO-END)

### Loan Creation as Data, Not Paper

Loan proposals are submitted through a structured interface that captures:

- Commercial terms
- Cashflow assumptions
- Risk factors
- Covenant logic
- Reporting obligations
- Sustainability commitments

Legal documents are interpreted and synchronised with this structured representation, ensuring that **what is legally agreed and what is operationally understood never diverge**.

The loan exists immediately as a **queryable, comparable digital object**.

### Capital Allocation as a Transparent Process

Capital providers define their participation criteria explicitly:

- Risk tolerance and downside limits
- Target returns and duration
- Sectoral and geographic constraints
- Sustainability and impact preferences

An allocation engine matches loan opportunities to capital profiles and produces **explainable allocation outcomes**, showing:

- Why a lender is participating
- How the loan fits their portfolio
- What risks they are assuming

Syndication becomes a **visible, rational process**, not a relationship-driven black box.

### Ongoing Governance Instead of Periodic Checking

Once allocated, the loan continues to operate within the platform:

- Financial performance is assessed against agreed metrics
- Covenant logic is evaluated as new information arrives
- Reporting deadlines and notices are tracked automatically
- Potential stress is surfaced early, not after failure

All relevant parties see the same state of the loan at the same time, reducing disputes and operational risk.

### Liquidity Without Surprises

Because each loan’s structure, history, and performance are continuously maintained:

- Transferability and consent requirements are always clear
- Potential secondary transactions can be assessed instantly
- Buyers see not just documents, but **behavioural history and compliance evidence**

This enables more confident and efficient movement of loan interests when liquidity is required.

### Sustainability Embedded, Not Reported After the Fact

Environmental and social commitments are captured as part of the loan’s economic logic:

- Sustainability targets are defined upfront
- Performance data is tracked continuously
- Outcomes are comparable across loans and portfolios

This allows sustainability to influence:

- Pricing
- Allocation
- Ongoing lender engagement

rather than being treated as a standalone reporting exercise.

## WHO THIS IS FOR

- Banks arranging and syndicating loans
- Private credit and institutional investors
- Loan agents and administrators
- Borrowers seeking transparent, efficient capital access
- Lenders with explicit sustainability mandates

## WHY THIS MATTERS

AutoSyndicate™ replaces:

- Manual interpretation with structured clarity
- Relationship-driven allocation with explainable logic
- Reactive monitoring with continuous governance
- Fragmented ESG reporting with embedded accountability

The result is a loan market that is:

- More efficient
- More transparent
- More resilient
- More scalable

without disrupting existing legal or regulatory frameworks.
