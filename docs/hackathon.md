# LMA EDGE Hackathon

Loan markets reimagined: practical, commercial, and scalable solutions for the multi-trillion dollar loan market.

The Loan Market Association is the authoritative voice of the loan markets across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our mission is to advance liquidity, efficiency, transparency and sustainability. The LMA Edge Hackathon invites a diverse mix of participants, from loan markets novice to subject matter expert, from fledgeling web developer to technology wizard, to reimagine how loans are originated, documented, traded and managed.

This hackathon is a call to build commercially viable, desktop-based prototypes, wireframes, or applications. The LMA website and our many LinkedIn posts can help you understand current practices, uncover pain points, and ideate bold solutions. With $25,000 USD in prizes, we’re looking for high-impact, scalable ideas that align with our values and our mission. If you’re motivated to apply technical creativity and cross-disciplinary thinking to a multi-trillion dollar market, this is your moment to shine.

## Requirements

### What to Build

Build or update a desktop-based project that can include but not limited to prototype/wireframe that is commercially viable in one of the following categories:

- Digital Loans
- Loan Documents
- Transparent Loan Trading
- Keeping Loans on Track
- Greener Lending

Key Components of Commercial Viability that should be considered when building your project:

- Value proposition
- Scalability potential
- Potential efficiency gains
- Potential Impact

## INSPIRATION FOR CATEGORIES

- Digital Loans - Loan agreements exist as complex long form legal documents, rather than as data. How can we apply technology to gather relevant data from these documents and represent that data in a structured digital form? How can we standardise the data gathered across the loan industry and facilitate interoperability between disparate systems, comparison between loans, querying and reporting.
- Loan Documents - Loan agreements are typically complex long form documents running to many hundreds of pages. It takes a significant amount of time to accurately capture the commercial deal in the document, and negotiate the terms between the lender and the borrower. How could we speed up the creation and negotiation process? Or make it easier to spot inconsistencies when terms change last-minute?
- Transparent Loan Trading - Lenders’ interests in loan agreements are bought and sold every day on the secondary loan market. For this to happen, certain procedural steps and due diligence need to be performed by the buyer of that interest. How might we automate due diligence checks that raise the cost of trades?
- Keeping Loans on Track - Loan agreements set out a wide range of obligations on Borrowers, including adhering to various financial covenants, providing timely information and notifying other parties of specified events. These obligations can differ from one loan to the next. How can Borrowers and Lenders efficiently gather and distribute relevant information to ensure compliance with these requirements?
- Greener Lending - Across the financial sector, there is growing demand for transparency and accountability around environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Lenders and borrowers are under pressure from investors, regulators and the public to demonstrate how capital is being used to support sustainable outcomes. However, ESG obligations and reporting requirements vary widely between loans, and data on performance is often fragmented, unverified, or difficult to compare. How might we make it easier to capture, verify and share ESG data across parties? Or help lenders factor sustainability into their decision-making?

## Submission Requirements

Submissions to the Hackathon must meet the following requirements:
